(* 
An Inductive definition does two things:
It defines a set of new constructors. E.g., red, primary, true, false, monday, etc. are constructors.
It groups them into a new named type, like bool, rgb, or color.
 
Constructor expressions are formed by applying a constructor 
to zero or more other constructors or constructor expressions
matching the structure of the definition


red, green, and blue belong to the set rgb;
black and white belong to the set color;
if p is a constructor expression belonging to the set rgb, 
then primary p (pronounced "the constructor primary applied to the argument p")
is a constructor expression belonging to the set color; and
constructor expressions formed in these ways are the only ones belonging
to the sets rgb and color.

Modules

Coq provides a module system to aid in organizing large developments.
We won't need most of its features, but one is useful: 
If we enclose a collection of declarations between Module X and End X markers, 
then, in the remainder of the file after the End, these definitions are referred
to by names like X.foo instead of just foo. 
We will use this feature to limit the scope of definitions, 
so that we are free to reuse names.

The names S and O are arbitrary, and at this point they have no special meaning
-- they are just two different marks that we can use to write down numbers (together with a rule that says any nat will be written as some string of S marks followed by an O).

(* 
However, there is a fundamental difference between S and the other two: 
functions like pred and minustwo are defined by giving computation rules 
-- e.g., the definition of pred says that pred 2 can be simplified to 1 --
while the definition of S has no such behavior attached. 
Although it is like a function in the sense that it can be applied to 
an argument, it does not do anything at all! It is just a way
of writing down numbers. *)
