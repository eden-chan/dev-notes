(* list is a function from Types to Inductive definitions;

Intuitively, it is (X : Type) â†’ list X.

Which of the following are well-typed elements of grumble X for some type X? (Add YES or NO to each line.)
d (b a 5)           NO since it has to use the mumble constructor 
d mumble (b a 5)    YES. type grumble mumble. Uses mumble constructor, where (b a 5) is type mumble because (1 2 3) in the mumble constructor, b=1 matches, a=2 matches since a is a mumble type, and 5=3 matches since 5 is nat
d bool (b a 5)      NO, because (b a 5) expects to be a bool
e bool true         YES, type grumble bool
e mumble (b c 0)    YES, type grumble mumble
e bool (b c 0)      NO because it expocts (b c 0) to be bool

(* Implicit Arguments *)

(* The Arguments directive specifies the name of the function (or constructor)

(* But don't make everything implicit. Consider the following list'  *)
Inductive list' {X:Type} : Type :=

(* Because X is declared as implicit for the entire 
inductive definition including list' itself, we now 
have to write just list' whether we are talking about 
lists of numbers or booleans or anything else, rather than 
list' nat or list' bool or whatever; this is a step too far. *)

(* So let's stick with our original implementation of list but with 
the Arguments for nil, cons defined to treat their leading terms as implicit *)

(* So we explicitly supply the generic type arg X for the list constructor, but not for the function type arg *)
