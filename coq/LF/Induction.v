  simpl. (* Does nothing! *)
Abort.

Theorem add_0_r_secondtry : forall n:nat,
  n + 0 = n.
Proof.
  intros n. destruct n as [| n'] eqn:E.
  - (* n = 0 *)
    reflexivity. (* so far so good... *)
  - (* n = S n' *)
    simpl. (* ...but here we are stuck again *)
Abort.

 (* 
the principle of induction over natural numbers: 
If P(n) is some proposition involving a natural number n 
and we want to show that P holds for all numbers n,
we can reason like this:
show that P(O) holds;
show that, for any n', if P(n') holds, then so does P(S n');
conclude that P(n) holds for all n.
