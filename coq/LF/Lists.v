Require and Import are used often together
But they do different things. 
Require loads the file. 
Import manages the name space. 

When coq files (DIR/File.vo) are loaded with Require,
 the contents of File.vo is wrapped in 
 Module DIR.FILE 
 ... 
 End 
Everything defined in the file is then accessed with 
      DIR.FILE.SOME_DEF
      
The file can itself have modules M (MODULE) inside of it.
To access contents of M, type 
    DIR.File.MODULE_M.SOME_DEF_IN_MODULE_M

    Import gets all definitions to the top level.
Import DIR.FILE.MODULE_M gets SOME_DEF_IN_MODULE_M to the top level,

Inductive step: l1 = n :: l1' where the IH is

By definition of rev, app_length, we get

Theorem: For all lists l, length (rev l) = length l.

(* Write down an interesting theorem bag_count_sum 
about bags involving the functions count and sum, 
and prove it using Coq. 
(You may find that the difficulty of the proof depends
 on how you defined count! 
 Hint: If you defined count using =? you may find it
 useful to know that destruct works on arbitrary
 expressions, not just simple identifiers.) *)
