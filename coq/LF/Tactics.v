Theorem silly1 : forall (n m : nat),
  n = m ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m eq.
  apply eq. (* alternatively "rewrite → eq. reflexivity."*)
Qed.

(* 
The apply tactic also works with conditional 
hypotheses and lemmas: if the statement being applied
 is an implication, then the premises of this implication
will be added to the list of subgoals needing to be proved.
*)
Theorem silly2 : forall (n m o p : nat),
  n = m ->
  (n = m -> [n;o] = [m;p]) ->
  [n;o] = [m;p].
Proof.
  intros n m o p eq1 eq2.
  apply eq2. apply eq1. Qed.


(* 
Typically, when we use apply H, the statement H
 will begin with a ∀ that introduces some universally 
 quantified variables. When Coq matches the current goal
 against the conclusion of H, it will try to find appropriate
 values for these variables. For example, when we do apply 
 eq2 in the following proof, the universal variable q in 
 eq2 gets instantiated with n, and r gets instantiated with m.

    apply eq1.
    apply eq3. 
Qed. 
(* 
To use the apply tactic, the (conclusion of the) 
fact being applied must match the goal exactly 
(perhaps after simplification) -- for example,
apply will not work if the left and right sides of the equality are swapped. 

In this case, use symmetry tactic.

    (* 
    If we simply tell Coq apply trans_eq at this 
    point, it can tell (by matching the goal 
    against the conclusion of the lemma) that it 
    should instantiate X with [nat], n with [a,b], 
    and o with [e,f]. However, the matching process doesn't determine an instantiation for m: we have to supply one explicitly by adding "with (m:=[c,d])" to the invocation of apply.

(*
Recall the definition of natural numbers:
     Inductive nat : Type :=
       | O
       | S (n : nat).

Implicit in the definition are two additional facts: 

The constructor S is injective (or one-to-one). 
    That is, if S n = S m, it must be that n = m.
The constructors O and S are disjoint. 
    That is, O is not equal to S n for any n. 

Similar principles apply to every inductively 
defined type: all constructors are injective, 
and the values built from distinct constructors 
are never equal. For lists, the cons constructor 
is injective and nil is different from every 
non-empty list. For booleans, true and false 
are different. (Since true and false take no 
arguments, their injectivity is neither here nor 
there.) And so on.

Qed.
(* 
This technique can be generalized to any 
constructor by writing the equivalent of pred -- 
i.e., writing a function that "undoes" one application of the constructor.
As a more convenient alternative, Coq provides a
tactic called injection that allows us to exploit 
the injectivity of any constructor. Here is an 
alternate proof of the above theorem using injection:

(*  False => Vacuously True  

The principle of disjointness says that two terms beginning with different constructors (like O and S, or true and false) can never be equal. This means that, any time we find ourselves in a context where we've assumed that two such terms are equal, we are justified in concluding anything we want, since the assumption is nonsensical.
The discriminate tactic embodies this principle: It is used on a hypothesis involving an equality between different constructors (e.g., false = true), and it solves the current goal immediately.

(* 
Theorem: For any nats n and m, if double n = double m, then n = m.
Proof: 
Let m be a nat. We prove by induction on m that, for any n, 
  if double n = double m then n = m.
First, suppose m = 0, and suppose n is a number 
  such that double n = double m. We must show that n = 0.
Since m = 0, by the definition of double we have double n = 0. 
There are two cases to consider for n.
 If n = 0 we are done, since m = 0 = n, as required. 
 Otherwise, if n = S n' for some n', we derive a contradiction: 
  by the definition of double, we can calculate double n = S (S (double n')), 
  but this contradicts the assumption that double n = 0.
Second, suppose m = S m' and that n 
  is again a number such that double n = double m. 
  We must show that n = S m', with the induction hypothesis
  that for every number s, if double s = double m' then s = m'.
  By the fact that m = S m' and the definition of double, 
  we have double n = S (S (double m')). 
  There are two cases to consider for n.
    If n = 0, then by definition double n = 0, a contradiction.
Thus, we may assume that n = S n' for some n', and again by the definition of 
double we have S (S (double n')) = S (S (double m')), which implies by injectivity 
that double n' = double m'. Instantiating the induction hypothesis with n' thus allows 
us to conclude that n' = m', and it follows immediately that S n' = S m'. 
Since S n' = n and S m' = m, this is just what we wanted to show. ☐
