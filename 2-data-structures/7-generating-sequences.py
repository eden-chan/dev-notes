# Augmented Assignment with Sequences (+= and *=)

__iadd__ and __imul__ are the special methods to implement
By default in a+=b, if a does not implement __iadd__ then a+=b has the same effect as a = a + b 
So a + b is evaluated firs, producing a new object that is then bound to a. 
Thus the identity of the object bound to a may or may not change, depending on the availability of __iadd__ 

In general, for mutable sequences, it is a good bet that __iadd__ is implemented and that += happens in place. For immutable sequences, clearly there is no way for that to happen.

# I thought it would yield (1, 2, [30, 40, 50, 60]) ðŸ˜…
# UPDATE: NO, it does yield (1, 2, [30, 40, 50, 60]) AND IT ALSO THROWS THE TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment ðŸ˜±

Key Takeaways: 
Avoid putting mutable items in tuples.

Augmented assignment is not an atomic operationâ€”we just saw it throwing an exception after doing part of its job.

Inspecting Python bytecode is not too difficult, and can be helpful to see what is going on under the hood.
